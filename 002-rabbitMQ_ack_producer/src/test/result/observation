1. if consumer consumes message and producer didn't receive ack signal,
    the message cannot complete
2. if consumer shut down,the message becomes ready state again
3. ack mode was set at application side ( application.yml )

---------------------------------------
4. 2 ack mode :
4a) producer and exchange
//class implements RabbitTemplate.ConfirmCallback,RabbitTemplate.ReturnsCallback

//override method confirm
4b) queue and consumer

4c) TODO : exchange and queue
--> don't know because it's auto binding set at RabbitMq server


---------------------------------------------

5. prevent duplicate message at consumer side
5a) store messsage id : msg pair at redis with limited time, bypass if already exist
    redisUtil.set(messageId,msg,10L);
